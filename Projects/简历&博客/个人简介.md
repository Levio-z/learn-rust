Peng Zhang

I hold a **Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science** from [Anhui University of Science & Technology (AUST)](https://jwc.aust.edu.cn/).  
Currently, I am actively seeking opportunities in **Rust-based systems programming**.

I previously worked at **Chery** for three years, primarily focusing on **backend development for connected vehicles**. My work involved:

- Real-name authentication data synchronization  
- The Xingtu Xingjiyuan mobile app  
- A WeChat mini-program for the work order system  
- Maintenance of the connected vehicle backend platform

In 2024, I also developed a **database-driven code generator**, which significantly accelerated the development of remote control protocol services.

I am passionate about:

- **Rust**  
- **Systems programming**  
- **low-level infrastructure**
- **AI**

I’m also an active contributor to the **open-source community**, and regularly participate in **open-source training camps**.

Rust projects:

- [**Design Patterns in Rust**](https://github.com/Levio-z/rust-design-patterns): A comprehensive and idiomatic implementation of classic design patterns  
- [**TCP/IP Stack in Rust**](https://github.com/Levio-z/tcp-rust): Built from scratch, with protocol-level implementations and test infrastructure  
- [Os in Rust](https://github.com/learn-rust-projects/os-rust):Built a small OS in Rust.
